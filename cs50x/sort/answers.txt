sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Testing with the given files we see that sort1 takes
longer time than the two others. If we analyse the time complexity of bubble
sort, we will see that it takes longer to sort compared to others. Because
it has a time complexity of O(n²), which is slower.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Testing again, but now with sort2, we can see that it's
the fastest way to sort, leaving us with no other choice than merge sort.
Just like above if we analyse the time complexity of merge sort, it has a
time complexity of O(n log n), which is the fastest option.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Last but no least, we see that sort3 it's a little faster
than sort1 (bubble sort) and slower than sort2 (merge sort). Leaving us with
selection sort, that it has a time complexity of O(n²), which is slower, but
not as slow than bubble sort, because as showed on the end of the class,
selection sort is faster than bubble sort even though it's the same time
complexity.
