Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With 100 simulations it took fewer seconds than 10 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

Giving the options, I guess 10000 simulations (0m0.114s) is the best option, because
it has a good amount of simulations and the time spended isn't too long.
